Its a basic course with a simple API using express and some more modules like:
- express-session,
- crypto to encript the user password,
- consign to auto-load routes, controllers and some other suff,
- mongodb native connector,
- ejs as the front-end library although the front-end wasn't the focus, will change this to react later.
